#+title: Popper.el

A minor-mode to help with the Emacs window flood. Designate any buffer to "popup" status, and it will stay out of your way. Disimss or summon it easily with one key. Useful for many things, including toggling display of REPLs, documentation, compilation or shell output, etc.

There is a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-xUNlZi3rI][detailed demo of Popper here]].

popper can place your popups for you, but it works best in conjunction
with some system to handle window creation and placement, like =shackle.el=.
This plugin summons windows defined by the user as "popups" by simply calling
=display-buffer=.

You can pre-designate any buffer (by name or major-mode) as a popup, and the status will be applied after window creation. 

Toggle a popup: 
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 500
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 500px
[[file:images/popper-toggle-latest.gif]]

Cycle through all your popups:
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 500
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 500px
[[file:images/popper-cycle.gif]]

Turn a regular window into a popup:
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 500
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 500px
[[file:images/popper-demote.gif]]

Or toggle all your popups at once:
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 500
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 500px
[[file:images/popper-toggle-all.gif]]

You can also promote a popup to a normal window.
* Usage
To designate popups in your init file, see the customization section.

There are two primary commands, you can bind them as convenient:

- =popper-toggle-latest=: Show/hide the latest popup. Does more with prefix args.
- =popper-cycle=: Cycle through your popups in sequence. With a prefix arg, cycle backwards.

Additionally, you can turn a regular window into a popup (or vice-versa) with =popper-toggle-type=, and kill an open popup buffer with =popper-kill-latest-popup=.

* Setup 
=popper= is available in MELPA, so you can install it with =M-x package-install RET popper RET= after adding MELPA to your package archives list.

** With =use-package=
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package popper
    :ensure t
    :bind (("C-`"   . popper-toggle-latest)
           ("M-`"   . popper-cycle)
           ("C-M-`" . popper-toggle-type))
    :init
    (setq popper-reference-buffers
          '("\\*Messages\\*"
            "Output\\*$"
            help-mode
            compilation-mode))
    (popper-mode +1))
#+END_SRC
See [[*Customization][Customization]] for details on specifying buffer types as popups.

** Without =use-package=
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'popper)
  (setq popper-reference-buffers
        '("\\*Messages\\*"
          "Output\\*$"
          help-mode
          compilation-mode))
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-`") 'popper-toggle-latest)  
  (global-set-key (kbd "M-`") 'popper-cycle)  
  (popper-mode +1)
#+END_SRC
See [[*Customization][Customization]] for details on specifying buffer types as popups.

* Customization
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       ce27af55-91a5-4549-97ac-d7f2c0aa9019
:END:
To get started, customize this variable:

- =popper-reference-buffers=: List of buffers to treat as popups. Each entry in the list can be a regexp (string) to match buffer names against, or a major-mode (symbol) to match buffer major-modes against.

  Example: 

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    '("\\\*Messages\\\*"
      "Output\\\*$"
      help-mode
      compilation-mode)
  #+END_SRC

  Will treat the following as popups: The Messages buffer, any buffer ending in "Output*", and all help and compilation buffers.

  There are other customization options, check the =popper= group.

** Grouping popups by context
Popper can group popups by "context", so that the popups available for display are limited to those that are relevant to the context in which =popper-toggle-latest= or =popper-cycle= is called. For example, when cycling popups from a project buffer, you may only want to see the popups (REPLs, help buffers and compilation output, say) that were spawned from buffers in that project. This is intended to approximate DWIM behavior, so that the most relevant popup in any context is never more than one command away.

Built in contexts include projects as defined in Emacs' built in =project.el= and =projectile=, as well as the default directory of a buffer. To set this, customize =popper-group-function=. You can also provide a custom function that takes no arguments, is executed in the context of a popup buffer and returns a string or symbol that represents the group/context it belongs to.

**  Managing window placement
In keeping with the principle of least surprise, all popups are shown in the same location: At the bottom of the frame. However this means you can't have more than one popup open at a time. You may also want more control over where individual popups appear. For example, you may want an IDE-like set-up, with all help windows open on the right, REPLs on top and compilation windows at the bottom. This is best done by customizing Emacs' =display-buffer-alist=. Since this is a [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/The-Zen-of-Buffer-Display.html#The-Zen-of-Buffer-Display][singularly confusing task]], I recommend using =popper= with a package that locks window placements, /e.g./ [[https://depp.brause.cc/shackle/][Shackle]].

*** Default popup placement:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq popper-display-control t)  ;This is the DEFAULT behavior, you don't need this
#+end_src

*** Popup placement controlled using =display-buffer-alist= or =shackle.el=:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package shackle
   :config
   ;; -- shackle rules here --
   )

  (use-package poup-buffers
  :config
  ;; -- popper customizations here--

  (setq popper-display-control nil))
#+end_src

* Technical notes
=popper= uses a buffer local variable (=popper-popup-status=) to identify if a given buffer should be treated as a popup. Matching is always by buffer and not window, so having two windows of a buffer, one treated as a popup and one as a regular window, isn't possible (although you can do this with indirect clones). In addition, it maintains an alist of popup windows/buffers for cycling through.

By default, it installs a single rule in =display-buffer-alist= to handle displaying popups. If =popper-display-control= is set to =nil=, this rule is ignored. You can change how the popups are shown by customizing =popper-display-function=, the function used by =display-buffer= to display popups, although you are better off customizing =display-buffer-alist= directly or using Shackle.
